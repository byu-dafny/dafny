## Error: Function _name_ has no body

```dafny <!-- %check-translate -->
function f(): int
```

The given function has no body, which is OK for verification, but not OK for compilation --- the compiler does not know what content to give it.

## Error: Function _name_ must be compiled to use the {:test} attribute

```dafny <!-- %check-translate -->
function {:test} f(): int { 42 }
```

Only compiled functions and methods may be tested using the `dafny test` command, which tests everything marked with `{:test}`.
However this function is a ghost function, and consequently cannot be tested during execution.
If you want the function to be compiled,
declare the function as a `function` instead of `ghost function` in Dafny 4 
or as `function method` instead of `function` in Dafny 3.

## Method _name_ is annotated with :synthesize but is not static, has a body, or does not return anything
